My OOP assignment is a HUD display for a spaceship
the circles that are moving to the left and the right are there to show the effect of speed whilst moving through space.
The spaceship can shoot red lasers into space by clicking on the mouse.
The control panel for my spaceship is at the bottom and is grey, it has a radar which maps where you are shooting.
In the middle of my control panel is a speedometer which runs in accordance to the speed the ship is travelling at which can be changed by pressing the up and down keys on the mouse

I coded stars by individually drawing them and done setting a speed variable for them known as starSpeed, this changed when the up and down keys were pressed.
the radar is coded by mapping range of the height and width of the program to the range of the pixels of my radar.And for the 
the speedometer is coded by mapping the range of the starSpeed to the range of the size of the speedometer.
the spaceship also shoots lasers by drawing a line from its gun to the position of MouseX and MouseY
